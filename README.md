<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I am deeply passionate about robotics and possess a strong foundation in robot-related knowledge. My coding profiency extends to various aspects of robotics application, including Robotics Software Development, development in Linux environment and ROS (Robot Operating System), which are essential tools in my field.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, I am fervent about  machine learning, machine vision, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). These cutting-edge fields represent the forefront of technological innovation in intelligent systems, and I am committed to exploring and contributing to these domains.
